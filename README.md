# üî¢ FastSudoku

This repository contains a **super efficient** implementation of a Sudoku solving algorithm capable of handling **any valid** [9x9 Sudoku puzzle](https://github.com/theargcoder/FastSudoku/blob/main/board_validator/solution_post.md).

The latest version can solve *almost* any board in **under 9 microseconds (Œºs)** ‚Äî that‚Äôs **under 9 millionths of a second**!

The algorithm uses techniques like **Minimum Remaining Values (MRV) Backtracking** to accelerate the solving process.


## üí® LeetCode Performance

solution can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1599823069/) and another one [here](https://leetcode.com/submissions/detail/1600120920/)

> note that the variance of the times is massive, their testing VM is shit 

- **0 ms** runtime ‚Äî beats **100%** of C++ submissions ‚è±Ô∏è
- **29.51%** better than other solutions in memory usage üß†


## üî• IMPORTANT DISCLOSURE üî•

All benchmark results were obtained under **controlled conditions** using the **selected board** (#x) for the 10k test, and a **fixed batch of 12 test cases** for cumulative timing ‚Äî similar in style to how **LeetCode** benchmarks.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All binaries were compiled using the `-Ofast` optimization flag.

**TESTED ON:**  
- `Linux macbook-air 6.13.7-arch1-1 #1 SMP`  
- `PREEMPT_DYNAMIC Thu, 7 Apr 2025`  
- `11:34:00 +0000 x86_64 GNU/Linux`

## üì• Download, Compile & Run It Yourself

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/theargcoder/FastSudoku/
cd FastSudoku
```
### OPTIONAL 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Edit the following in `board_solver/main.cpp`

- `test_individual`, `test_n_times`, and `test_commulative` functions ‚Äì modify these to suit your test style.

- `boards_gpt`‚Äì update this vector to try out your own boards.

- You can also uncomment previous versions of the solver to benchmark them too!

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Compile inside `board_solver/` with:

For **some** compiler **optimization**
```bash
 g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -O2 main.cpp -o main
```

For **a lot** of compiler **optimization**
```bash
 g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -O3 main.cpp -o main
```

For **THE MOST** compiler **optimization** possible
```bash
 g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Ofast main.cpp -o main
```


## THANKS

Enjoy the speed. üß†üí®
